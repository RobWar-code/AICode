<h1>AI Code - Example Sequences

1) Sequence of numbers from output position 0
    INC A                           1/56
    STO (C), A                      1/56
    INC C                           1/56
    JR 0xFD (or lower)              1/(56 * (256 - (127 - 2)))

1A) Example from AI Code
    DEC B               B:255        B:1            B:254
    STO (C), A          O(0):0       O(255):0       O(2):255
    INC A               A:1          A:1            A:0
    INC A               A:2          A:2            A:1
    SWP A, C            A:0, C:2     A: 255:, C:2   A:2, C: 1
    SWP B, C            B:2, C:255   C:1, B:255     B:1, C:254
    JR 0x8E
 
<h1>Toward Stepped Pathways
Having tested the app as at 05/12/2025 - we find that code
entities plateau with a score of about 1/3 of the maximum
using a mixture of random number and series transfers to
output, but also a degree of reading from the input.

These scores were achieved after about 80 million trials
and scoring progress was very slow indeed at this point.

The most likely account for this is that further improvement
would require very low probability events in the breed/mutate
cycle.

Here, we consider stepped pathways, in which no progressive
step has a probability lower than a certain threshold.

So let us consider some sequences.

Firstly consider

LDI A, (C) // LD A from the input buffer
STO (C), A // ST A in the output buffer
INC C 
JR 0xFC // Jump relative back to start

Using the rule sets, this scores on valuesSet, outputFromInitialParams, outputMatchesInitialParams
