<h1>Ruleset Strategies

<h2>General Approaches
    Step 1) Put values in the output
    Step 2) Put a series in the output
    Step 3) Put a set of different values in the output
    Step 4) Read the input and place in the output
    Step 5) Read the input and modify in a simple way (eg: +3)
    Step 5a) input -2
    Step 5b) input *2
    Step 5c) input /2

<h2>valuesSet
    Since the primary aim is to produce out, the first rule
    is valuesSet this checks each byte of the output to see
    if a non-zero value has been set. The score is a factor
    of 1 per byte set over the tested range.

    A typical sequence of entity code required to get the 
    maximum for this rule would be:

    INC A
    STO (C), A
    INC C
    JR [0xFD]

<h2>valuesOutMatchInputParams
    This is tested for in a specific block of 8 bytes and
    specific set of input parameters, so not only must the
    operating entity discover the necessary output, but also
    the specific inputs.

<h1>AI Code - Example Sequences

1) Sequence of numbers from output position 0
    INC A                           1/56
    STO (C), A                      1/56
    INC C                           1/56
    JR 0xFD (or lower)              1/(56 * (256 - (127 - 2)))

1A) Example from AI Code
    DEC B               B:255        B:1            B:254
    STO (C), A          O(0):0       O(255):0       O(2):255
    INC A               A:1          A:1            A:0
    INC A               A:2          A:2            A:1
    SWP A, C            A:0, C:2     A: 255:, C:2   A:2, C: 1
    SWP B, C            B:2, C:255   C:1, B:255     B:1, C:254
    JR 0x8E
 
<h1>Toward Stepped Pathways
Having tested the app as at 05/12/2025 - we find that code
entities plateau with a score of about 1/3 of the maximum
using a mixture of random number and series transfers to
output, but also a degree of reading from the input.

These scores were achieved after about 80 million trials
and scoring progress was very slow indeed at this point.

The most likely account for this is that further improvement
would require very low probability events in the breed/mutate
cycle.

Here, we consider stepped pathways, in which no progressive
step has a probability lower than a certain threshold.

So let us consider some sequences.

Firstly consider

LDI A, (C) // LD A from the input buffer
STO (C), A // ST A in the output buffer
INC C 
JR 0xFC // Jump relative back to start

Using the rule sets, this scores on valuesSet, outputFromInitialParams, outputMatchesInitialParams
