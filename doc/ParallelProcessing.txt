Parallel Processing - Initial Study

    Adapt Existing Program to Multiprocessing

<h1>Introduction

    It is intended that the project be transferred onto
    a multi-processor PC to enable parallel processing
    for deeper searches of the probability field by the
    system.

    By consulting with chatGPT on the various possible
    approaches for a node/electron application it was
    decided that the main processing task should be
    split-out to an independent app so that this can
    be duplicated for parallel processing.

<h1>Initial Set-up
    The proposed system upon which the application is
    to run is a hexacore PC running Windows-11, rather
    than Linux. This is adequate because VS-Code and
    Electron/MySql can operate on both Linux and Windows
    environments.

    It is necessary to install node and MySql and then
    electron for the project, replacing the default
    src directory created by that from AICode.

    1. Create the Projects directory
    2. Install VS-Code
    3. Connect-up to the AICode Project on GitHub
    4. Pull the AICode project from GitHub
        git pull origin main

<h1>Adapt Existing Program to Multiprocessing

    The idea here is to modify the existing program
    to test for a single processor and adjust
    for workerApp use accordingly.

    Copy the MainControl.js file to WorkerApp.js ready
    for adaptation.

    Prepare the MainControl batch processing loop
    function that checks the number of processors
    available and sets the loop controls and display
    intervals etc. accordingly.
