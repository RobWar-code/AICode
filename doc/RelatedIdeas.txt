Current System Status

The current project appears to get as far as simple arrangements
like subtractFirstParam, and multiply and modulo with the use of
of templates. Although it is conceivable that the system might
progress further with the right combination of rules and the
process of learning from seed rules, it may well be worth considering
variants of the approach to establish the general validity of the
evolutionary code approach to machine learning.

As the system stands it is the system as whole which "learns" by
the accumulation of solutions and solution fragments that may be useful 
in solving other problems. The learning at the entity program level
is all by selective scoring, and sometimes this may fail because
stepwise solutions to the problem are not available, or because the
intermediate scores move the system further from the solution 
probabilistically.

The decision to be made at this juncture is whether to keep
refining the existing model, or to extend the theory with the aim
of writing a new model, or substantially reworking the existing
model.

Before moving on to reworking, let us consider whether the existing
limitations can be overcome.

Existing Limitations 

    Stepwise Score Traps 
        These may be caused by coincidental matching of values
        in the output that deflect away from the algorithm.

        This problem can be partially overcome by scoring
        required instructions in the program code range.
        However, this leans toward foreknowledge.

        Could statistical code position analysers guide 
        mutations/manipulations?
